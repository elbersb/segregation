\title{Calculate detailed within-category segregation scores for M and H}
\usage{
mutual_within(
  data,
  group,
  unit,
  within,
  weight = NULL,
  se = FALSE,
  CI = 0.95,
  n_bootstrap = 100,
  base = exp(1),
  wide = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{group}{A categorical variable or a vector of variables
contained in \code{data}. Defines the first dimension
over which segregation is computed.}

\item{unit}{A categorical variable or a vector of variables
contained in \code{data}. Defines the second dimension
over which segregation is computed.}

\item{within}{A categorical variable or a vector of variables
contained in \code{data} that defines the within-segregation categories.}

\item{weight}{Numeric. (Default \code{NULL})}

\item{se}{If \code{TRUE}, the segregation estimates are bootstrapped to provide
standard errors and to apply bias correction. The bias that is reported
has already been applied to the estimates (i.e. the reported estimates are "debiased")
(Default \code{FALSE})}

\item{CI}{If \code{se = TRUE}, compute the confidence (CI*100)% confidence interval
in addition to the bootstrap standard error.
This is based on percentiles of the bootstrap distribution, and a valid interpretation
relies on a larger number of bootstrap iterations. (Default \code{0.95})}

\item{n_bootstrap}{Number of bootstrap iterations. (Default \code{100})}

\item{base}{Base of the logarithm that is used in the calculation.
Defaults to the natural logarithm.}

\item{wide}{Returns a wide dataframe instead of a long dataframe.
(Default \code{FALSE})}
}
\value{
Returns a data.table with four rows for each category defined by \code{within}.
  The column \code{est} contains four statistics that
  are provided for each unit:
  \code{M} is the within-category M, and \code{p} is the proportion of the category.
  Multiplying \code{M} and \code{p} gives the contribution of each within-category
  towards the total M.
  \code{H} is the within-category H, and \code{ent_ratio} provides the entropy ratio,
  defined as \code{EW/E}, where \code{EW} is the within-category entropy,
  and \code{E} is the overall entropy.
  Multiplying \code{H}, \code{p}, and \code{ent_ratio} gives the contribution of each within-category
  towards the total H.
  If \code{se} is set to \code{TRUE}, an additional column \code{se} contains
  the associated bootstrapped standard errors, an additional column \code{CI} contains
  the estimate confidence interval as a list column, an additional column \code{bias} contains
  the estimated bias, and the column \code{est} contains the bias-corrected estimates.
  If \code{wide} is set to \code{TRUE}, returns instead a wide dataframe, with one
  row for each \code{within} category, and the associated statistics in separate columns.
}
\description{
Calculates the segregation between \code{group} and \code{unit}
within each category defined by \code{within}.

\examples{
(within <- mutual_within(schools00, "race", "school",
    within = "state",
    weight = "n", wide = TRUE
))
# the M for state "A" is .409
# manual calculation
schools_A <- schools00[schools00$state == "A", ]
mutual_total(schools_A, "race", "school", weight = "n") # M => .409

# to recover the within M and H from the output, multiply
# p * M and p * ent_ratio * H, respectively
sum(within$p * within$M) # => .326
sum(within$p * within$ent_ratio * within$H) # => .321
# compare with:
mutual_total(schools00, "race", "school", within = "state", weight = "n")
